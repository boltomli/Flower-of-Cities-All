Such was the rise of this prodigious fire,\\
Which in mean buildings first obscurely bred,\\
From thence did soon to open streets aspire,\\
And straight to palaces and temples spread.

The diligence of trades and noiseful gain,\\
And luxury, more late,\footnote{\textbf{more late}: later to bed than honest tradesmen.} asleep were laid;\\
All was the night's, and in her silent reign,\\
No sound the rest of nature did invade.
